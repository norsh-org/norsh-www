			"text": "Norsh is not just a blockchain. It is a new standard that removes the limits of Web 3.0. We have created an ecosystem that eliminates existing barriers and makes operations more efficient, transparent, and direct. With imperceptible latency, costs reduced to the essential, and no obstacles for those who develop, use, or innovate, in any environment: public, corporate, industrial, or governmental.<br><br>We believe that true progress comes from improving what already exists. “Reinvent the Wheel” does not mean changing for the sake of change, but evolving with purpose. If something works, we keep it. If it gets in the way, we replace it. We do not follow trends or dogmas, only what truly adds value.<br><br>The future of blockchains will no longer be defined by restrictions but by the opportunities we can create. That is exactly why Norsh exists, to build a new path that is secure, intelligent, structured, and free of barriers for the future."
